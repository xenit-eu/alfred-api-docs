# About
Alfred API abstracts away past and future changes to the Alfresco, across major and minor 
versions, providing a stable interface to Alfresco on which client-side applications can be built.

It also provides functional grouping of related operations from the Alfresco Public API,
and additional endpoints that are not supported by the Alfresco Public API.
