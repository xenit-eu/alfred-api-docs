# Supported Alfresco versions
Currently Alfred API supports the following Alfresco versions:

* 5.0
* 5.1
* 5.2
* 6.0
* 6.1
* 6.2

# Pre-requisites
Alfred API requires **_Dynamic Extensions For Alfresco_**, version 2.0.1 or later. This module should be installed first.
Acquisition and installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/xenit-eu/dynamic-extensions-for-alfresco).

# Artifacts
## Prebuild
Artifacts can be freely obtained through [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:eu.xenit.apix).
The application is available as an alfresco amp artifact, which is the preferred distribution for production environments. 

To install the AMP, follow the Alfresco AMP installation guidelines your version of Alfresco: [5.0](https://docs.alfresco.com/5.0/tasks/amp-install.html), [5.1](https://docs.alfresco.com/5.1/tasks/amp-install.html), [5.2](https://docs.alfresco.com/5.2/tasks/amp-install.html), [6.0](https://docs.alfresco.com/6.0/tasks/amp-install.html), [6.1](https://docs.alfresco.com/6.1/tasks/amp-install.html) or [6.2](https://docs.alfresco.com/6.2/tasks/amp-install.html).

A Dynamic Extensions jar artifact is also available.

## Sourcecode
The source code is available from [Github](https://github.com/xenit-eu/alfred-api), but building the artifacts requires access to Alfresco Enterprise libraries to satisfy enterprise dependencies.
